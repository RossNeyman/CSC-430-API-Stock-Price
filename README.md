# Stock Market Trivia Game

This project aims to create a stock market trivia game in which players must correctly guess the date a stock was listed on the stock market. This project utilizes the [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) API. Currently, it selects randomly from stocks in the S&P 500 index.

## Getting Started

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain an API Key**  
   - Sign up for an account at [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/)  
   - Retrieve your API key from the dashboard  

2. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project  
   - Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `your_api_key` with your actual key:  

     ```env
     POLYGON_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

Now you're ready to run the program!
